# Password Generator

## How to use:
The program has one required argument, the desired password length, and an optional one, to turn off symbols in passwords

To use the program, enter on your terminal:

* python pwgen.py

The program will ask whether you want symbols and how long you want the password.

The password length cannot be less than 3 (w/ no symbols) or 4 (w/ symbols).
This is due to how the passwords are initially generated.
Obviously, no program should allow you to make passwords that short.
